        <h2>How to store Pho</h2>

        <h2>How to Freeze Pho</h2>
        <p>You can only freeze the pho broth, not the rice noodles. Store completely cooled broth in airtight containers or zip-top freezer bags (frozen flat) in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat on the stove.</p>
