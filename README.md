# odin-recipes

The main project is to complete the tasks on the TOP https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

By completing the projects I want to see where are my weak points and develop a better understanding of Web Development and programming in general.

Concepts list:
-Git
-GitHub
-Command Line Interface
-Html
-Css
-JavaScript // DOM, functions and algorithms
-How is the workflow of a good progammer and what are the best practices and community standards
-Decide on what should I focus next to improve my skills as a programmer
