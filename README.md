# odin-recipes

The main project is to complete the various tasks on the TOP https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

Concepts list:
-Git
-GitHub
-Command Line Interface
-Html
-Css
-JavaScript // DOM, functions and algorithms
-Workflow as a progammer, what are the best practice and community standards
-Decide on what should I focus next to improve my skills
